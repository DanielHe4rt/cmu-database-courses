# CMU Courses Notebook

Hey! I'm Daniel and this is my notes on the CMU 2022 course "Intro to Database Systems / Fall 2022" by Andy Pavlo.

My idea is to take notes on each class that I watch and proper store my notes together with projects made on this course.


## Notes 

Feel free to open any issue or PR to correct any of my notes.
